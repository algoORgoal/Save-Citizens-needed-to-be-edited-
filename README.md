This is a repository for the game `Save Citizens` that I exhibited in the competition held in [Seongnam High School](https://seongnam-h.goesn.kr/seongnam-h/main.do) in 2018.

# How to run
To run this game, you need to have GameMaker Version 2.1.5.322 found in [Release Notes of GameMaker2](https://gms.yoyogames.com/ReleaseNotes.html). Please note that it can only run on Windows.

# How to play
It's a simple one-player game. You're the ninja in a dangerous city. There are citizens and enemies in the city and they are only moving horizontally. You'll get the score if you shoot only enemies among these objects. However, if you shoot citizens, You lose your heart. You have 5 hearts in total and if you lose them all, the game is over.
